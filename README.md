**rev1:** is tested and operating at about 1.7TH/s average speed.<br>
**rev2:** working fine with the expected speed of ~1.8TH/s avg after some minor modifications (330ÂµF caps are wrongly placed, see rev3)<br>
**rev3:** Fixed Caps placement and added Boot-Switch. It should put the STM32 into DFU bootloader but not tested yet.



Installation
=============

As programming/debug adapter the Picoprobe firmware running on a Raspi Pico works best: <br>

<br>
<br>
There also is a little board with only 3 parts that gives a nice low-cost solution to flash the Qaxe:<br>
